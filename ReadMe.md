# üß† Free Motion ‚Äì AI Day Planner (Notion + python)

A lightweight AI-driven daily planning system powered entirely by **Notion**.  
It connects your **Projects** and **Tasks** databases with an AI assistant (like ChatGPT) to help you plan, reflect, and organize your day automatically.


## Video Demo


## üöÄ Overview

This assistant is composed of two Python scripts:

1. **`morningPrompt.py`** ‚Äì Reads your **Notion Projects** and **Tasks** databases, and builds a full ‚Äúmorning prompt‚Äù to start your day with ChatGPT or another LLM.
2. **`actionNonchy.py`** ‚Äì Executes structured commands output by your AI (like `ADD_TASK`, `UPDATE_PROJECT`, etc.) directly on your Notion workspace.

No cloud dependencies, no Google API, no credential setup.  
Everything runs through your Notion integration.

# üìï Creator's note:
The way I use this, is you wake up, open the terminal. cd to the ~/free-motion, then "python morningPrompt.py", paste the prompt to chatgpt or your favorite llm, MAKE SURE TO EDIT THE PROMPT TEMPLATE at the end of it I make it give me news I care about you can change that whatever you want. then have a convo on what tasks you want/need to be done by the end of the day, ask it to give you the commands to add the tasks, or add them manually. Once you paste the prompt you can run "python actionNonchy.py" so you have that waiting for commands. You can paste the add task commands to you task list, then after that you can have a chat with the llm about the tasks and how your day will look then you ask it to give you a mock schedule for the day, i like to give it an amount of time i d like to spend on some tasks like "2h of cpu work", and once you like the schedule you guys came up with, ask it to give you to the schedule commands paste them on the terminal then voila. see the demo video...

## üß† Database Setup

You can either **duplicate the ready-made Notion templates** or **create them manually**.

### Option A ‚Äì Import templates
You can duplicate these template pages into your Notion (once available):  
- **Projects DB Template** link: https://www.notion.so/285ea28cce5a8089bb16c0ce00ae53eb?v=285ea28cce5a814f9a9c000c68266a71&source=copy_link
- **Tasks DB Template** link: https://www.notion.so/285ea28cce5a8015ace5e851fe488e76?v=285ea28cce5a812bb0cd000c7c99f94e&source=copy_link

### Option B ‚Äì Create manually

#### üß± Projects Database
Name your database: **Projects**  
Required columns:
| Property Name | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| `Project Name` | Title | Main project title |
| `Status` | Status | Example values: Not Started, In Progress, Complete |
| `Tags` | Multi-select | Keywords (e.g., ‚ÄúHardware‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI‚Äù) |
| `Last Step` | Text | Most recent progress or action |
| `Next Step` | Text | Upcoming planned action |
| `Summary` | Text | Short project description |

#### ‚úÖ Tasks Database
Name your database: **Tasks**  
Required columns:
| Property Name | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| `Name` | Title | Task name |
| `Done` | Checkbox | Mark completed tasks |

Both databases **must use the same property names** as listed above.  
If you rename or remove any column, the Python scripts will fail to fetch data.
